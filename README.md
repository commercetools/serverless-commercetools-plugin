## Features

- Attach a newly deployed serverless function as a commercetools' API extension.
- Create a new serverless function to process events from a commercetools' subscription.
- Supports AWS and GCP

## Install

```sh
npm i --save-dev serverless-commercetools-plugin
# or
yarn add --dev serverless-commercetools-plugin
```

Add the following plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-commercetools-plugin
```

With the [serverless CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/plugin-install/)

```sh
serverless plugin install --name serverless-commercetools-plugin
```

## Configuration

Add your commercetools' project settings to the serverless.yaml file. Add these values under the provider section:

```yaml
provider:
  environment:
    CTP_PROJECT_KEY: "your_key"
    CTP_CLIENT_SECRET: "your_secret"
    CTP_CLIENT_ID: "your_clientid"
    CTP_AUTH_URL: "your_authurl"
    CTP_API_URL: "your_apiUrl"
    CTP_SCOPES: "your_scopes"
```

### API Extension

Add environment vars for the deploy type ("extension") and your body configuration for the [Extension](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-api-extensions).

```yaml
    CTP_DEPLOY_TYPE: "extension"
    CTP_POST_BODY: '{
        "destination": {
          "type": "AWSLambda",
          "accessKey": "your_aws_key",
          "accessSecret": "your_aws_secret"
        },
        "triggers": [{
          "resourceTypeId": "cart",
          "actions": ["Create", "Update"]
        }]
    }'
```

_Note: The Lambda ARN is determined by the plugin. You do not need to include it in the configuration._

_For Google Cloud Platform functions set the CTP_POST_BODY to use the HTTP destination as outlined in the [commercetools API Extension documentation.](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/api-extensions#http-destination)_

### Subscription

Add environment vars for the deploy type ("subscription") and your body configuration for the [Subscription](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-subscriptions).

```yaml
    CTP_DEPLOY_TYPE: "extension"
    CTP_POST_BODY: '{
        "destination": {
          "type": "AWSLambda",
          "accessKey": "your_aws_key",
          "accessSecret": "your_aws_secret"
        },
        "triggers": [{
          "resourceTypeId": "cart",
          "actions": ["Create", "Update"]
        }]
    }'
```
